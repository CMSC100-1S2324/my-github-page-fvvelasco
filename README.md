How to create a live github page
1. Make a Github repository
2. Clone the Github repository
3. Add the files for your website in the folder
4. Push the files to the remote repository
5. Go to your repository then settings then pages.
   Make sure the source is on "Deploy from a branch" and select the branch
   your website files are.

CSS is good for styling your website to your suiting. I also learned I'm not good
at web designing. There is still a lot of things I need to know about github since
I'm really interested at what more it does and could help me a lot.
